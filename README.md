# Indigo Events
Our app's purpose is to showcase available events to users in their city, sorted by date. The user will also be
able to make a reservation for the event that he/she is interested in and review his/her past
reservations. The idea came from looking back at SFF events. Those events were packed
with all kinds of different content. There was something for everyone. We wanted to give
users the ability to review events like that online more easily and make their reservation.
